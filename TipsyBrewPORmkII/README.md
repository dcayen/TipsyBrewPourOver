# TipsyBrew Pour Over Robot (POR) MkII

### NOTE: Until I say otherwise, MkII is a work in progress. If you start purchasing or printing parts to work along with me, I welcome you. However, until hardware is finalized I can't guarantee that money or effort won't be wasted.

This code is used on an Arduino MEGA 2560 with integrated ESP8266, like this one https://robotdyn.com/mega-wifi-r3-atmega2560-esp8266-flash-32mb-usb-ttl-ch340g-micro-usb.html.
