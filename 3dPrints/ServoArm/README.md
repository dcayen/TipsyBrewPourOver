# Servo Arm

I was going to write a bunch of stuff about this servo arm, but I realized something. I already did over at [TipsyBrew.com's entry on the pour arm](https://tipsybrew.com/blog/2020-04-27-new-pour-arm/).

I do want to say though, that I did not previously release this model because I'm not in love with it. It may not work perfectly for your servos because the ones I used at the time were ancient and slightly different. If I decide to still use this concept (why? because unlike other brewers, mine is actually used), then I will refresh it based on commercially available servos of a modern era. This should be close enough to work for 2 standard sized servos, but your milage may vary. The construction also uses entirely too many screws, but it actually worked on the first revision so I didn't have my typical cycle of revisions to make it more efficient.
