### Diaphragm Pump Mount
This mount is pretty basic and not the most elegant but works great. It is for a 12V diaphragm pump that was supplied to me by a generous TipsyBrew Discord user. The pump head is slightly larger than the motor, so there are two separate brackets. Each bracket has a top that goes around the pump and a bottom that gets sandwiched between the pump and the surface you are attaching it to. Although I have not tried it, I suppose you could just use one or two brackets on just the motor or just the head part. The screw holes were made for a #6 screw (sorry metric people, it is what I had laying around).
