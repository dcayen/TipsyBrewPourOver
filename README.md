# TipsyBrew Pour Over Edition
This is an exploratory/educational project that will attempt to tackle a few basic tasks of brewing a damn good cup of coffee.

So the design and approach of this project is to emphasize simplicity and approachability. The basic problems being solved here could be done many ways, but I am going to approach it with these priciples:
1. Use basic consumer items and realtively easy to obtain electrical components.
2. Make it educational. I am hoping people follow along with this project as it unfolds. I will try to break it down to basic concepts so that you can either learn, skim, or critique.
3. Take what you want from it. I'm not going to have this project completed tomorrow and my decisions may not suit all your needs. But if I move too slow for you and you are capable enough, jump right ahead of my progress. If you are looking to say heat your water with some volcanic geothermal situation going on near you, dump my water heating solution.
4. Cover the basics first. If you make a feature request for a something like a touchscreen or wifi before I can make a solid cup of coffee, expect me to ignore it. I believe in simplicity first. However, this is an open project so if you want to add that in a branch, go for it.
5. Communication. I will do my best to convey the reasons behind my decisions as I go. I am sure I will make some mistakes, so please do your best to reciprocate in a constructive manner.
