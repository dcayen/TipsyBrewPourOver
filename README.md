# TipsyBrew Pour Over Robot (POR for short)
This is an exploratory/educational project that will attempt to tackle a few basic tasks of brewing a damn good cup of coffee.

So the design and approach of this project is to emphasize simplicity and approachability. The basic problems being solved here could be done many ways, but I am going to approach it with these priciples:
1. Use basic consumer items and realtively easy to obtain electrical components. I want to use very common hobbiest level components so that you can easily use what you may have or what you can easily and cheaply obtain where possible. I also want the design to be easily adapted so if you are not able to get the same exact item or you can get a similar one for half the cost then you should do so without major project changes.
2. Make it educational. I am hoping people follow along with this project as it unfolds. I will try to break it down to basic concepts so that you can either learn, skim, or critique.
3. Take what you want from it. I'm not going to have this project completed tomorrow and my decisions may not suit all your needs. But if I move too slow for you and you are capable enough, jump right ahead of my progress. If you are looking to say heat your water with some volcanic geothermal situation going on near you, dump my water heating solution.
4. Cover the basics first. If you make a feature request for a something like a touchscreen or wifi before I can make a solid cup of coffee, expect me to ignore it until later. I believe in simplicity first. However, this is an open project so if you want to add that in a branch, go for it.
5. Communication. I will do my best to convey the reasons behind my decisions as I go. I am sure I will make some mistakes, so please do your best to reciprocate in a constructive manner.

Keep tabs on the everyday progress of this project at [TipsyBrew](https://tipsybrew.com/tags/pourover/). Project code and models will be stored here on GitHub though.

## earlyPhase.ino
This is the exact code that the Phase 0.5 demonstration used. There are some slight issues with this, but nothing that prevents a cup of coffee from being made. I would have preferred to hold it back for some polishing before putting it up here, but I am trying to fight those instincts and make this as public as possible. As always, check [TipsyBrew](https://tipsybrew.com/blog/2020-03-01-success-first-cup-video/) for the 0.5 demonstration and related news on the [pour over project](https://tipsybrew.com/projects). Early Phase was kind of like the moon shot code to demonstrate that the POR would work. It is still being used to make coffee daily to fuel Tipsy during mkII progress, but it is not long for this world.

## Mk II has begun
Mark II of the POR is aimed towards a complete kit for others to build. That means I am trying to create a stable design. At the moment of writing it will be the leading edge design, but once completed I will do my best to heavily document it and hopefully a community will grow with it.
